## 2. üîç File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) with Wazuh

As part of this project, I implemented **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)** using **Wazuh** to detect unauthorized file changes on an Ubuntu agent. FIM is essential for identifying potential security incidents by tracking file creations, modifications, and deletions in real time.

---

### ‚úÖ Enabling FIM on the Ubuntu Agent

To enable File Integrity Monitoring on the Ubuntu agent, I edited the Wazuh agent‚Äôs configuration file:

1. I opened the agent configuration file located at:

```bash
sudo nano /var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf
```

## Ossec Configuration- Opening the ossec.conf file]
<img width="1920" height="1020" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d73dc533-cc44-432d-ac63-19a6a9569778" />

2. Within the `<syscheck>` block, I added the `/root` directory for real-time monitoring. Below is the snippet I inserted:

```xml
<syscheck>
  <directories check_all="yes" realtime="yes">/root</directories>
</syscheck>
```

## Monitoring the Root Directory - Added /root to syscheck block
<img width="1920" height="1020" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/16e6ef56-d80e-47aa-8df0-7feb597b14cd" />

> I chose to monitor the `/root` directory because it contains sensitive administrative files. Monitoring this directory helps detect any unauthorized or suspicious activity. Note that proper permissions are required for the Wazuh agent to access this directory.

3. After editing, I saved the file and restarted the Wazuh agent to apply the changes:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart wazuh-agent
```

---

### üß™ Testing FIM Functionality

To verify that FIM was working as expected, I performed a series of actions in the `/root` directory:

1. **Created a test file:**

```bash
touch sample.txt
```

2. **Modified the file by adding content:**

```bash
echo "This is a modification text" >> sample.txt
```

3. **Deleted the file:**

```bash
rm sample.txt
```

## File creation, modification, and deletion test

---

### üìä Viewing FIM Alerts in the Wazuh Dashboard

To confirm that the file changes were detected:

1. I logged into the Wazuh Dashboard.
2. Navigated to:  
   `Modules` ‚Üí `File Integrity Monitoring`
3. Filtered the alerts and confirmed that the following events were recorded:

- **File creation** (`sample.txt`) ‚Äî *Rule ID 554*
- **File modification** (Checksum changed) ‚Äî *Rule ID 550*
- **File deletion** ‚Äî *Rule ID 554*

## 3. Automated Threat Blocking with Wazuh Active Response

### üö´ Detecting and Blocking SSH Brute-force Attacks

Active Response is a powerful feature in Wazuh that enables automatic remediation actions‚Äîsuch as blocking a source IP address‚Äîwhen specific rules or behaviors are detected. This allows security teams to reduce response time and contain threats as they occur.

In this lab, I configured Wazuh to automatically detect and block SSH brute-force attacks using the built-in `firewalldrop` active response command.

---

### ‚öô Step 1: Enabling Active Response on the Wazuh Manager

I began by confirming that Active Response was enabled on the agent by inspecting the `/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf` file.

Then I added the following configuration to the Wazuh Manager (`ossec.conf`) to trigger firewall rules when SSH brute-force activity is detected:

```xml
<command>
  <name>firewalldrop</name>
  <executable>firewalldrop</executable>
  <expect>srcipt</expect>
</command>

<active-response>
  <command>firewalldrop</command>
  <location>local</location>
  <rules_id>5763</rules_id>
  <timeout>180</timeout>
</active-response>
```

# ossec.conf edit/setup
<img width="867" height="667" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9ce61dd9-fb45-4691-9fd0-b7bf0251d8ff" />

**Explanation:**

* `firewalldrop`: Executes an IP blocking rule using the host firewall.
* `rules_id: 5763`: Matches SSH authentication failure alerts.
* `timeout: 180`: Blocks the IP for 3 minutes.
* `location: local`: Executes the command on the local agent.

Then restart the Wazuh Manager:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart wazuh-manager
```

---

### üß™ Step 2: Simulating an SSH Brute-force Attack

To test the setup, I simulated an SSH brute-force attack from Kali Linux using Hydra:

```bash
hydra -l root -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh://<target-ip>
```

# Kali Brute-force Attack
<img width="1920" height="1020" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/60af4b02-b41d-4d1b-a206-c31d837d4980" />

This generated a series of failed SSH login attempts.

---

### üìä Step 3: Monitoring Alerts and Response in Wazuh

Navigate to:

```
Security Events ‚Üí Agent ‚Üí Ubuntu
```

Here‚Äôs what I observed:

* ‚ö†Ô∏è Multiple alerts for failed SSH logins (`rule id 5760`)
* ‚úÖ An active response alert:
  `Host blocked by firewalldrop active response with rule id 651`

This confirmed that:

* Wazuh detected the brute-force behavior
* The attacking IP was automatically blocked
* Further login attempts were silently dropped

# Alerts Generated

## 4. SQL Attack Monitoring
# üìò Apache Log Monitoring with Wazuh Agent (Ubuntu Endpoint)

This document outlines the steps I followed to install Apache on an Ubuntu endpoint, configure the Wazuh agent to monitor Apache logs, and emulate an SQL injection attack to validate detection.

---

## üîß Step 1: Install Apache Web Server

I began by updating the package list and installing Apache:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install apache2
```
# Apache2 Installation
<img width="957" height="1018" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6834d01a-1192-40af-b531-4be4c3d7b462" />

---

## üîê Step 2: Configure the Firewall (If Enabled)

Since UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) was enabled, I allowed access to web traffic:

```bash
sudo ufw app list
sudo ufw allow 'Apache'
sudo ufw status
```

# Firewall Configuration
<img width="958" height="1019" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0c2abb44-8aa4-4a39-9685-a1bbf918b9d6" />
.

---

## ‚úÖ Step 3: Verify Apache Is Running

To ensure the web server was running:

```bash
sudo systemctl status apache2
```


I verified the default Apache landing page by opening the following URL in a browser:


http://192.168.0.108


```bash
curl http://192.168.0.108
```

# Apache Page 
<img width="957" height="1018" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4fb83a92-ef1a-4da8-8fc3-4f0a07210e47" />

---

## üìÑ Step 4: Configure Wazuh Agent for Apache Log Monitoring

I edited the Wazuh agent configuration file to include monitoring for Apache logs:

```bash
sudo nano /var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf
```


Inside the `<ossec_config>` block, I added the following:

xml
<localfile>
  <log_format>apache</log_format>
  <location>/var/log/apache2/access.log</location>
</localfile>

# Apache ossec configuration on Agent
<img width="957" height="1018" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb2fb32e-c1d6-4827-9729-9cca1d02cb6b" />

Then, I restarted the Wazuh agent to apply the changes:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart wazuh-agent
```


---

## üß™ Step 5: Simulate an SQL Injection Attack

To test Wazuh‚Äôs ability to detect web-based attacks, I simulated a simple SQL injection from my Kali VM:

```bash
curl -XGET "http://192.168.0.108/users/?id=SELECT+*+FROM+users"
```
# SQL Attack Simulation 
<img width="1920" height="1020" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dc78c54f-bac0-4bb7-8c3c-f43fd6beddad" />

---

## üìä Step 6: Review Alerts in Wazuh Dashboard

After executing the simulated attack, I checked the Wazuh dashboard for alerts.

> ‚úÖ *Result:* An alert was triggered with **Rule ID 31103**, indicating a detected SQL injection attempt.

# Alerts Generated on Wazuh Dashboard
<img width="1920" height="1020" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f0da38e7-e136-4067-b9ba-5c33bf462013" />


# Alerts Details
<img width="1920" height="1020" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/97ae8069-0002-4ce8-85de-7d4d9c9321ac" />

<img width="1920" height="1020" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7de76789-ab9f-45ab-a5c0-38117276d5bc" />

---

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

This setup confirms that Wazuh can successfully monitor Apache logs and generate alerts for suspicious activity such as SQL injection. By enabling log monitoring on the Ubuntu endpoint and validating the alert response, I ensured that my Wazuh deployment is capable of detecting web application attacks.

## 5. üõ°Ô∏è Real-Time Malware Detection and Active Response with Wazuh on Ubuntu

In this project, I configured a Wazuh environment to detect malicious files in near real-time using File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) on an Ubuntu endpoint. When suspicious files are detected, they are analyzed using VirusTotal, and if confirmed malicious, Wazuh automatically removes them using an Active Response script. Here‚Äôs how I set it all up.

---

### üîß Ubuntu Endpoint Configuration

#### ‚úÖ Enabling File Integrity Monitoring

I started by enabling FIM on the Ubuntu endpoint. I edited the Wazuh agent configuration file at `/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf` and made sure the `<syscheck>` module was enabled:
<br>
# FIM 
<img width="957" height="1018" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/39aac80d-9107-4466-9566-c04c79a6e600" />
picture 1

```xml
<syscheck>
  <disabled>no</disabled>
  <directories realtime="yes">/root</directories>
</syscheck>
```

This setup ensures that any change in the `/root` directory is monitored in real time.

#### üß∞ Installing Dependencies

I installed `jq`, a tool that helps parse JSON data in the Active Response script:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y jq
```

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Active Response Script

Next, I created a custom Active Response script to remove malicious files. I saved the script as `/var/ossec/active-response/bin/remove-threat.sh` with the following content as shown in the screenshot below:
<br>
# Custom Rule Configuration 
<img width="1920" height="1020" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0b51c6f1-4eee-47bc-9664-a5cb0f6d8450" />


Then I updated the script's ownership and permissions to make it executable by Wazuh:

```bash
sudo chmod 750 /var/ossec/active-response/bin/remove-threat.sh
sudo chown root:wazuh /var/ossec/active-response/bin/remove-threat.sh
```
<br>

# Ossec Configuration 
<img width="957" height="1018" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ddae2708-0b2b-40e4-ac98-52142ff0238e" />

Finally, I restarted the Wazuh agent:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart wazuh-agent
```

---

### üß† Wazuh Server Configuration

#### üîç Local Rules for File Monitoring

On the Wazuh server, I then navigated to the wazuh dashboard, then to the rules section. There, i searched for the local_rules.xml and edited it with the following rules: rules that generate alerts when files are added or modified in the `/root` directory:
<br>
# Rules Configuration
<img width="1920" height="1020" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba7c5cd5-201d-4d43-8de2-713cc5e39121" />

```xml
<group name="syscheck,pci_dss_11.5,nist_800_53_SI.7,">
  <rule id="100200" level="7">
    <if_sid>550</if_sid>
    <field name="file">/root</field>
    <description>File modified in /root directory.</description>
  </rule>

  <rule id="100201" level="7">
    <if_sid>554</if_sid>
    <field name="file">/root</field>
    <description>File added to /root directory.</description>
  </rule>
</group>
```

#### üîó Enabling VirusTotal Integration

To analyze suspicious files, I integrated VirusTotal by editing `/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf` on the Wazuh manager. I added the following block (replacing the placeholder with my actual API key) as shown:
<br>
# Virus Total API Key Configuration
<img width="960" height="1020" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd9f1dda-f323-43d6-87e5-ab6c106035bd" />



#### üö® Setting Up Active Response

To make Wazuh automatically remove malicious files flagged by VirusTotal, I added the following sections to the same config file as shown in the screenshot.
<br>
<img width="960" height="1020" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/091278af-f0e8-41be-8bd7-2afdb6738cd6" />



I also added rules in the local_files to log whether the file was successfully removed or not as shown:
<br>
<img width="1920" height="1020" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba7c5cd5-201d-4d43-8de2-713cc5e39121" />


Lastly, I restarted the Wazuh manager:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart wazuh-manager
```

---

### üß™ Attack Emulation

To test the setup, I downloaded the EICAR test file, which is a harmless file designed to trigger antivirus alerts:

```bash
sudo curl -Lo /root/eicar.com https://secure.eicar.org/eicar.com
```
<br>

# Downloading EICAR test file to trigger virus
<img width="894" height="185" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b08b4222-d5bb-4e52-a1e3-7ed4d1dc90bb" />

Wazuh detected the new file, triggered a rule, forwarded the alert to VirusTotal, and since it‚Äôs a known test virus, it was flagged and automatically removed by my script. As shown in the picture:
<br>
# Wazuh Dashboard Alerts
<img width="1920" height="1020" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dc618cf0-2d6c-45c8-afb8-77fb4adf8f49" />


---

### üìä Visualizing Alerts

In the Wazuh dashboard, I opened the **Threat Hunting** module and used the appropriate filters to confirm the alerts. I could see:

- File creation detected by FIM
- VirusTotal scan results
- Active response result (file removed)

---

### ‚úÖ Summary

This setup demonstrates how I integrated real-time file monitoring, threat intelligence via VirusTotal, and automated response using Wazuh. It showcases the power of endpoint protection using open-source tools and how to automate incident response workflows.
